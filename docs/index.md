<center>**A developer friendly wrapper for kuda API**</center>
<hr/>
Documentation: []()

Source Code: [https://github.com/jennyosato/pykuda2](https://github.com/jennyosato/pykuda2)
<hr/>
PyKuda2 is a python wrapper over the [Kuda Open API](https://kuda.notion.site/Kuda-Developer-Documentation-d1ddd29b97e441c592323201f7f6b42f).
It aims at being developer friendly and easy to use.


The key features are:

* **Type hints**: All methods provided by PyKuda2 are type annotated, so you can easily infer. This improves the
  development experience.
* **Async support**: PyKuda2 allow you to also make calls to Kuda Open API using async/await which is super great
  for example if your project is in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) where every chance of a performance 
  improvement is adds up.

## Requirements
Python 3.9+

PyKuda2 uses [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) under the hood to make API calls to Kuda.

## Installation
<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input">pip install pykuda2</span>
    <span data-ty="progress"></span>
    <span data-ty>Successfully installed pykuda2</span>
</div>

## Example
```py title="Trying out PyKuda2"
import os
from pykuda2 import Kuda

# Fetch your credentials from your environment path
KUDA_EMAIL_ADDRESS = os.getenv("KUDA_EMAIL_ADDRESS")
KUDA_API_KEY = os.getenv("KUDA_API_KEY")

# Instantiate the Kuda API wrapper
kuda = Kuda(email=KUDA_EMAIL_ADDRESS, api_key=KUDA_API_KEY)

# Get the admin account balance
response = kuda.accounts.get_admin_account_balance()
print(response)

# Get transaction history
response = kuda.transactions.get_transaction_history(page_size=50, page_number=1)
print(response)
```
All you need to interact with Kuda's Open API in your python project is the `Kuda class` it has [attributes](reference/kuda.md#attributes-on-the-kuda-and-asynckuda-classes)
bounded to it that provides methods you can call in your code to make API calls to Kuda. Every method call on the wrapper
has the same return type, which is an [APIResponse](reference/utils.md#pykuda2.utils.APIResponse). A data class containing
the data from making the actual call to Kuda servers 

## Async Too!
PyKuda2 also lets you use `async/await` out of the box. See what it looks like in a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
project.
```py title="PyKuda2 in async/await mode üòé"
import os
from pykuda2 import AsyncKuda
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Fetch your credentials from your environment path
KUDA_EMAIL_ADDRESS = os.getenv("KUDA_EMAIL_ADDRESS")
KUDA_API_KEY = os.getenv("KUDA_API_KEY")

# Instantiate the Kuda API wrapper
kuda = AsyncKuda(email=KUDA_EMAIL_ADDRESS, api_key=KUDA_API_KEY)
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/banks")
async def get_banks():
  response = await kuda.transactions.get_banks()
  return response.data

```
